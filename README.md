## Purpose
This repo was built alongside a series of blogs to allow developers to follow along writing tests for React. The blog walks through each piece of functionality being built starting from this [initial point](https://github.com/Lawton/react-testing-example/tree/initial). The blogs follow a test driven approach, but the main structure of writing tests is also explored.

The first blog entry can be found [here](https://medium.com/tribalscale/tutorial-on-testing-react-part-1-2c587e39114d)
